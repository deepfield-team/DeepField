## Open datasets

This folder contains a set of reservoir models to play with `DeepField` framework:
* Egg model ([source](https://doi.org/10.1002/gdj3.21)) with simulated dynamics. Unzip the `RESULTS.zip` archive before reading the model with DeepField
* Egg restart model with simulated dynamics. Unzip the `RESULTS.zip` archive before reading the model with DeepField
* SPE 10 - MODEL 2 ([source](https://github.com/OPM/opm-data/tree/master/spe10model2))

For details and terms of use of the models, see the description in the model directory.

Additionally, in a number of tutorials we will use the Norne reservoir model. The source data of the model can be obtained, for example, from the `opm-data` repository https://github.com/OPM/opm-data/tree/master/norne.
